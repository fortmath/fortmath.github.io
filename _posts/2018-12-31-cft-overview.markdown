It's been a long time since I write a blog of any sort. A big reason is the overhead blogging incurs. Now that circumstances have changed, I would like to give blogging a shot again.

This blog would be used for my own musings/organization of thoughts and stuff. Using Mathjax on Jekyll seems to be a better idea than wordpress free version - we'll see how that goes.

Anyway, since I started to look at class field theory again lately (something I never quite understand) - it sounds like a great first topic to start. So here we go.
